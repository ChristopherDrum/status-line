A set of modified Infocom games that work great with Status Line are in the sibling repository, [Status Line Classics](https://github.com/ChristopherDrum/status-line-classics)

The project is getting more complex and needs proper version control from now. This repository begins with v2.0 of the source code which supports z3 and z4 game files.  Once v2.x feels stable, work will begin on v3.0 which will finalize this project by adding z5 (and likely z7/8) support.
